There are several types of medications used to treat asthma. These can be divided into two main types: quick-relief medications for immediate relief during an asthma attack, and long-term control medications used to prevent symptoms and manage asthma over time.

Quick-Relief Medications (Rescue Inhalers):

Short-acting Beta Agonists (SABAs): These are the most commonly used medications for quick relief of acute symptoms and prevention of exercise-induced asthma. Examples include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA) and levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA).
Anticholinergics: These can help with severe symptoms or when a patient can't tolerate SABAs. An example is ipratropium (Atrovent).
Oral and Intravenous Corticosteroids: These reduce inflammation in the airway and are used for severe asthma exacerbations. An example is prednisone.
Long-Term Control Medications:

Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS): These are anti-inflammatory medications that reduce swelling and mucus production in the airways, making the airways less sensitive. Examples include fluticasone (Flovent), budesonide (Pulmicort), and ciclesonide (Alvesco).
Long-Acting Beta Agonists (LABAs): These are bronchodilators used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids to control moderate to severe asthma. Examples include salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil).
Combination Inhaled Medicines: These contain both an ICS and a LABA. Examples include fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair), budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort), and mometasone/formoterol (Dulera).
Leukotriene Modifiers: These are oral medications that help prevent asthma symptoms for up to 24 hours. An example is montelukast (Singulair).
Theophylline: This is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open by relaxing the muscles around the airways.
Biologic Therapy Medications: These are used for severe asthma that doesn't respond to other treatments. Examples include omalizumab (Xolair), mepolizumab (Nucala), and reslizumab (Cinqair).


Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):
Symptoms:
Frequent urge to urinate
Pain or burning sensation during urination
Cloudy or strong-smelling urine
Blood in the urine
Lower abdominal pain or discomfort
